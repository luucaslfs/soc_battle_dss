# Esoccer Battle DSS

A DSS project I made to help me taking decisions in sports betting.

## The Process

In this project I started using  data from an website that stores information about all the matches played in the last months in that championship, using BeatifulSoup
Then I cleaned and preprocessed the data, saving it in a simple way it could be used later (csv), using Pandas.
To finish, the program made some calculations and comparisons to better understand certain encounters between two players.

With the help of this project, I was able to make more than 5 digits in my local currency last year before being blocked by almost all the bookmakers with false and unproven allegations of breaking the rules. 

## Quick Start

1 - Run the blocks one by one.
2 - Choose the two teams and what you want to see from them at the last code block.
3 - Run that last block.
